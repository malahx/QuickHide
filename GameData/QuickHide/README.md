#### What is it?

QuickHide is a plugin which adds the possibility to hide the stock toolbar.

#### How does it work?

You have two solutions to use QuickHide:
- with the mouse: Put your mouse where is the stock toolbar and it will be shown,
- with the Blizzy Toolbar (an optional mod), it will only hide the mods from the stock toolbar.

You can enable/disable auto hide on the file "GameData/QuickHide/Config.txt" (put MouseHide to false).

#### How to install it?

Unzip all files. Put the QuickHide folder in your KSP/GameData folder.

#### How to uninstall it?

Delete the QuickHide folder in your KSP/GameData folder.
